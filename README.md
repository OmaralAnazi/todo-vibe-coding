# TODO App - Experimental Project

A simple, elegant TODO application built with React, TypeScript, and Chakra UI. This project was created as a "Vibe Coding" experiment using Cursor IDE to explore modern web development practices and tools.

## About This Project

This project was built entirely using Cursor IDE as a "Vibe Coding" experiment in AI-assisted development. It demonstrates how modern AI tools can help streamline the development process while maintaining code quality and best practices. The term "Vibe Coding" reflects our approach of building this project in a relaxed, experimental manner, focusing on learning and exploration rather than strict production standards.
